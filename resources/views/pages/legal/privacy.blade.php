            <h5>
                <p>Like most website operators, Bitller SRL collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bitller SRL’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bitller SRL’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Bitller SRL may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            </h5>

            <h4 class="paragraph-title"><strong>Colectarea informațiilor de identificare personală</strong></h4>
            <h5>
                <p>Certain visitors to nova-manager.com choose to interact with the website in ways that require Bitller SRL to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Bitller SRL gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a free account to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Bitller SRL - by purchasing subscriptions, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Bitller SRL collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with nova-manager.com. Bitller SRL does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
